// Director OpenCode plugin (_managedBy: director — do not edit; managed by `director install --opencode`).
//
// This file IS the OpenCode shim: where Claude Code and Codex run bash shims
// that pipe hook stdin JSON to `director _hook <event>`, OpenCode hooks are
// in-process function calls — so this plugin fabricates the same CC-shaped
// payloads and applies the verb's control output to each hook's mutable output.
// The Go core is agent-agnostic and unchanged; everything OpenCode-specific
// lives here.
//
// Event mapping (one line each):
//   chat.message        → SessionStart  (once per session; digest injected as a
//                         synthetic text part prepended to the first user message)
//   tool.execute.after  → PostToolUse   (heartbeat + optional nudge appended to
//                         the tool output)
//   session.idle        → Stop          (end-of-turn fleet bookkeeping; the
//                         emit-guard is inert here — no transcript — so any
//                         control output is deliberately ignored)
//   session.created     → subagent filter (a child session, parentID set, is
//                         skipped everywhere: no injection, no fleet rows;
//                         unknown ids — a resumed session after a server
//                         restart — are classified via client.session.get)
//   session.compacted   → immediate re-grounding: the resumed auto-continue
//                         turn does NOT pass through chat.message (OpenCode
//                         synthesizes it directly), so a compacted session
//                         gets the ground truth appended to its system prompt
//                         per request until the next real user message, where
//                         chat.message re-injects it durably (source=compact)
//
// Cardinal rule, same as the Go adapter (§13 t5): a broken hook must NEVER
// break a session. Every handler swallows every error; the worst outcome is
// silently absent coordination, never a blocked turn.
